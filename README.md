# Go EG Walker

A Go implementation of the EG Walker collaborative text editing algorithm.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development** ðŸš§

This library is currently being ported from the [TypeScript reference implementation](https://github.com/josephg/eg-walker-reference/tree/masters). The API is unstable and subject to change.

## Overview

EG Walker is a collaborative text editing algorithm designed to be performant for both online collaboration and merging long-diverged branches (offline work). It aims to combine the benefits of Operational Transformation (OT) and Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).

*(More details about the algorithm and its features will be added here)*
